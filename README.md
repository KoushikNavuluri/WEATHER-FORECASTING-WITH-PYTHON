## What is wttr?

> wttr â€” the right way to check the weather!

wttr.in is a console-oriented weather forecast service that supports various information representation methods like terminal-oriented ANSI-sequences for console HTTP clients (curl, httpie, or wget), HTML for web browsers, or PNG for graphical viewers.

wttr.in uses [wego](http://github.com/schachmat/wego) for visualization and various data sources for weather forecast information.

If you wish to know more about it, you can refer to [**wttr's** GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).
